# IrcClient4Net
Super simple IRC client for the .net Framework

# THIS PROJECT IS IN A VERY EARLY STAGE, LIKE... IT CAN SEND AND RECEIVE CHAT MESSAGES TO A TWITCH CHANNEL, THAT'S IT SO FAR

This library is specifically built for use with Twitch and Hitbox live stream chats so some features may be disabled or otherwise not work as intended.

Feel free to submit issues and pull requests, also if you want this library to work with more generic irc chats.

# For contributors
Please maintain the same structure and coding style as in the existing code for improved readability.
