# IrcClient4Net
*Stupid and super simple IRC client for the .net Framework*

The idea behind this repository is to provide a stupid and simple library that allows you to establish a connection to an IRC server without all sorts of strange features or odd logic that you may not like, want or need.

You get all the methods you need to connect and interact with the server along with methods that allows you to receive messages in a parsed format. You will have to do the rest yourself.

This library is specifically built for use with the Twitch live stream chats in mind so some features may be missing for now. Create an issue or submit a pull request and I'll look into it as soon as possible :)

I will do my best to keep twitch logic in its respective classes so you don't have to mess with that if you don't need it. I might even move it into its own repository eventually depending on how large that functionality or the basic framework evolves.

# In Development
This project is currently in development but it should include enough functionality for other to use at this time. Please submit an issue or pull request if you have any issues.

# For contributors
Please maintain the same structure and coding style as in the existing code for improved readability.
