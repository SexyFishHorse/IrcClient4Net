# IrcClient4Net
Super simple IRC client for the .net Framework

This library is specifically built for use with Twitch and Hitbox live stream chats so some features may be disabled or otherwise not work as intended.

Feel free to submit issues and pull requests, also if you want this library to work with more generic irc chats.
